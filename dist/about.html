            <p>The Armed Forces of Nigeria have been involved in several campaigns and battles since the world wars. They fought the Nigerian civil war, the war in Liberia and Sierra Leone and had largely been instrumental to maintaining peace and security in our country.</p>

            <p>In all these wars and conflicts, we have lost several men and women. Some of those who came back were forever scarred, some were emotionally traumatized while others were permanently maimed. Their children, spouses and family members also suffered from the effects of war on soldiers while most of them are disenfranchised towards the society which they feel had used and dumped them. The current influx of more veterans from the Northeast into the society could therefore add a new dimension to our current security challenges if urgent and appropriate actions are not taken to ensure our peaceful coexistence.</p>

            <p>The Federal Government has over the years borne the onerous burden of rehabilitating, caring and reintegrating our war veterans and providing for their dependents. However, the task is enormous and daunting due to other pressing issues and challlenges confronting the nation.</p>

           <p>It is also on record that the Armed Forces of Nigeria have commenced steps to ameliorate the plights of war veterans amidst other contending demands. The Green Heroes Foundation therefore believe that the problems faced  by our war veterans are enormous and multi-faceted and therefore should not be consigned to the Armed Forces alone as the requirements for reorientation and rehabilitation of war veterans back to civility must include complimentary efforts by well-spirited Nigerians, corporate organizations and friends of Nigeria to provide the much-needed support outside the scope and resources of the Armed Forces.</p>

           <p>As the American civil war was coming to an end in 1865, President Abraham Lincoln said... <b>Let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nations wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan.</b></p>  

           <p>These words spoken about 150 years ago are resonating today and urging us, I believe, to support the re-integration of our psychologically Traumatized, emotionally distressed and disabled war veterans into the society.</p>

           <p>In view of the foregoing, the Green Heroes Foundation (GHF) was officially launched on February 22, 2018. The GHF is a Non-Governmental Organization which is wholly run by retired military personnel with specialist supports from some well-meaning individuals and organizations. The Foundation is desiged to cater and support Nigerian Armed Forced war veterans as well as provide for their families in times of need.</p>

           <p>Accordingly, we will ensure that veterans seamlessly transit from active service to civilian society. We are poised to provide both short and long term supports that are delibrately designed to help ex-combatants and their dependents adjust to new emotional  social and economic realities and the "silent injuries of war"</p>

           <h2>Our core services include but not limited to:</h2>
    
            <div><i class="fa fa-check"> Reunion services</i></div>

            <div><i class="fa fa-check"> Reintegration services</i></div>
            <div><i class="fa fa-check"> rehabilitation of war veterans</i></div>
            <div><i class="fa fa-check"> Widows and orphans welfare support services</i></div>

           <h2>Objectives</h2>

           <div><i class="fa fa-check"> To provide counseling and rehabilitation service to war veterans.</i></div>
           <div><i class="fa fa-check"> To provide retooling and skills development for post-war experiences of veterans.</i></div>
           <div><i class="fa fa-check"> To promote research studies on post war conditions and understanding to both serving and retired veterans.</i></div>
           <div><i class="fa fa-check"> To promote the understanding of veteran welfare and integration.</i></div>
           <div><i class="fa fa-check"> To carry our advocacy, public enlightenment and education on war situation and the effects; as a way of promoting peaceful coexistence in Nigeria.</i></div>

        <h2>About us</h2>

        <p>In line with foregoing, Green Heroes Foundation initiative which composed mainly of retired military officers is designed to support and care for war veterans and their dependents. Our goal is to create awereness on the travails of the men (male/female) in uniform who are constantly exposed to threats and danger during and after active service.</p>

        <p>Due to the enormity of this problem, leaving it to the Armed Forces of Nigeria to treat acute and chronic medical needs, provide rehabilitation service and finally help them gain and maintain useful employment will never be sufficient. That is why we believe that these efforts must be complimented by well-meaning Nigerians and Corporate Organizations. Green Heroes Foundation intends to show the way by providing some of the much needed support outside the scope and resources of the Armed Forces of Nigeria.</p>

        <p>Consequently, we commenced full operations in February 2018 with few of the war veterans that we could cater for due to financial contraints. They are currently being catered for at our temporary hostel located inside Jazz and Blues Garden at Abidjan Street, Wuse Zone 3, in Abuja. There are several of them within our cities and villages living in fringes of the society they once served to protect and defend.</p>

        <p><b>We believe that it is our obligation to cater for those who might have borne the battles and suffered from the pains which became their gains while protecting us all. </b></p>
